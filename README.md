#Mental health prediction
Mental Health is a very important issue in today’s world . As in these days, a lot of people now working from home and even companies are preferring work from home, the mental health situation of the people has nose- dived to unbelievable levels. The main objective of the proposed project focuses on building an application that will try to collect the mental state of the user and provide close to accurate remedies – assigning tasks, connecting a doctor( or psychiatrist) etc. The application tries to find if an app user is suffering from any mental issue by asking a few psychological questions, and it suggests measures that the app users can believe to recover from their issue.The application will suggest tasks to them. The mental health of a person is predicted by using the machine learning algorithms. Apart from predicting the mental health of a person it also includes the basic information of mental health, and the disorders that a person faces due to the mental health that can be found in the causes, myths& facts and disorders in the website.
